    "It's an exciting time on Mars. Bruston University, in the martian state of Marsachusetts, needs to elect a new president. In a somewhat surprising turn of events, the martians, notoriously very democratic people, decided to let the students vote directly for one of the two candidates. The candidate with the higher number of student votes will be elected. One of the candidates, Rhett the Terrestrial Terrier, is going to give away free bagels every week, while the other candidate, Bob Blue, is planning to increase tuition fees for all the students. You want to poll the students to find out who they will vote for, and predict the outcome of the election.\n",

    "**Your comments:** The results are not very reliable when we poll 100 students because on average we fail about 38% of the time which is a very high level of uncertainty.  When polling 1000 students the level of certainty increases considerably although there still is about 11% failure which can be seen as significant. So we see that as the sample polled increased from 100 to 1000 students the probability of failure went down from about 39% to about 11% but it still remains rather significant if we consider 5% to be the target failure. In fact in my simulations, samples of size greater than 1500  will predict the results of this election within the 5% margins of error."

    "**Your comments:** Here we see that there is greater uncertainity in the results than we saw in the previous experiment, probably due to the fact that the split is much closer. Based on my simulations there was about a 28% failure when polling 1000 students, about a 19% failure when polling 2000 students and about 14% failure when polling  3000 students. We can see that as the sample size increases the probability of failure goes down considerably but much slower than in the previous experiment due to the fact that the split here is very close and even after polling 3000 students we have a failure rate of about 15%. We observe that in order to have a reliable result (<5% failure) it is important to poll more people than just 3000. In fact in my simulations, samples of size greater than 6000 will predict the results of this election within the 5% margins of error."
