    " **Answer:**\n",
    "     *According to the results of my simulation the right answer to the question is clearly (b), the smaller hospital recorded more days in which over 60% of the babies born are boys than the larger hospital in virtually every trial, namely 9998 out of 10000. This result agrees with my intuiton since the smaller hospital has only 15 births a day as opposed to 45. The smaller number of births allows for a greater variance in the percentage of boys born. As the number of babies born each day increases we expect the probability to approach 0.5 hence the discrepancy in the percentage of boys born between 2 hospitals.*"
